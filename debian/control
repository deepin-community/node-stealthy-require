Description: require function that bypasses the require cache.
 This is probably the closest you can currently get to require something in
 node.js with completely bypassing the require cache.
 .
 stealthy-require works like this:
 .
  * It clears the require cache.
  * It calls a callback in which you require your module(s) without the cache
    kicking in.
  * It clears the cache again and restores its old state.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
